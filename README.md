📌 In the age group of 26 to 35, the maximum attrition occurred.

📌 Maximum attrition happens in Life Sciences Education, i.e., 38%, and Laboratory Technician as a job role.

📌 Attrition is directly proportional to job satisfaction for different job roles. Hence, the lower the number, the higher the chance of attrition.

📌 Maximum attrition observed in employees having 1 to 2 years in the company.

📌 Also, the average salary is 6.5k, yet employees earning below that slab have higher chances of attrition
